dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.


Requirements
------------
In order to build dwm you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (dwm is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install dwm (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm


Configuration
-------------
The configuration of dwm is done by creating a custom config.h
and (re)compiling the source code.

Debug instructions
------------------

To run a nested X session and debug dwm you need Xnest installed
With it run `Xnest :1` in one terminal and `DISPLAY=:1 ./dwm` in another. If you generate debug symbols with `-g` you can use gdb with `DISPLAY=:1 gdb ./dwm`.
Here, :1 is the display number, as :0 is the default and would conflict with the active X session. Additionally, the config.h for this project changes the modifier key to Alt if you define `DEBUG` with `-DDEBUG`.

To test on multiple monitors use Xephyr and make sure xrandr and xinerama are enabled. For example `Xephyr -screen 960x540+0+0 -screen 960x540+960+0 +extension RANDR  +xinerama :1`
